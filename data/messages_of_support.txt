Be patient with yourself. Nothing in nature blooms all year.
Not all storms come to disrupt your life, some come to clear your path.
Remember, growing might feel like breaking at first
Give yourself another day, another chance. You will find your courage eventually. Don't give up on yourself just yet.
You can't heal if you keep pretending that you're not hurt
Healing is not linear
Give yourself a chance to develop and grow, to get where you want to be.
Work on yourself instead of breaking yourself because you're not there yet.
You cannot serve as your own motivating and criticizing 'enemy' if you're not simultaneously your own best friend and biggest fan. It works both ways.
Have patience with yourself. Nobody every got better overnight. You'll get wherever you need to be in time.
For now, remember that everyday that you survive is a step forward, and you have survived many tough days that you thought wouldn't pass. Be proud of yourself and keep going.
Forgive yourself. Not just once. Again, and again, and again. As many time as it takes to find peace
This morning, let go of everything you didn't do right, the negative things people have said, and focus on all you are becoming.
Love yourself, but take it slow. For love to bloom it requires time, patience, respect, understanding, and vulnerability. Accepting your true self and fallling in love with it is a process that cannot be devalued or rushed.
You're not a victim for sharing your story. You are a survivor setting the world on fire with your truth. And you never know who needs your light, your warmth, and raging courage. - Alex Elle
When you say "be yourself" to a friend, say it to yourself. When you say "it doesn't matter what others think of you" to your friend, say it to yourself. When you say "you're amazing just the way you are" to your friend, say it to yourself. Your dilusions of your significance are keeping you from becoming your strongest, most confident, version of yourself without validation of others
Remember, most of your stress comes from the way you respond, not the way life is. Adjust your attitude. Change how you see things. Look for the good in all situations. Take the lesson and find new opportunities to grow. Let all the extra stress, worrying, and overthinking go.
You can rise up from anything.
You can completely recreate yourself.
Nothing is permanent
You're not stuck.
You have choices.
You can think new thoughts
You can learn something new.
You can create new habits.
All that matters is that you decide today and never look back.
It's okay to admit that your wounds are still open. That you are still healing. It takes time.
Healing is weird. Some days you're okay and you're doing just fine. Other days it still hurts like it's fresh. It's a process with no definitive time frame. You just have to keep going and know that when all is said and done, you're going to be ok.
Let the version of yourself that you were, teach you.
Let the version of yourself that you were, comfort you.
Let the version of yourself that you are becoming, inspire you. You are the version that you need and needed to be in every phase of your journey
Everyday, make a tiny agreement with yourself and follow through with it. You'll start to see yourself as person who honours their word, even when no one's watching. And that's what creates true self-confidence
Don't give up.
Keep going
When you start to feel like things should have been better this year, remember the mountains and valleys that got you here. They are not accidents and those moments weren't in vain.
You are not the same. You have grown and you are growing, you are breathing, you are living. You are wrapped in endless, boundless grace. And things will get better. There is more to you than yesterday.
Instead of saying "I'm damaged, I'm broken, I have trust issues" say "I'm healing, I'm rediscovering myself, I'm starting over." Positive self talk
It's ok if you thought you were over it, but it hits you all over again.
It's okay to fall apart even if you thought you had it under control. You're not weak
Healing is messy. And there's no timeline for healing
One day you will tell your story of how you overcame that you went through and it will be someone else's survival guide.
It's okay if you don't know what to feel, if you don't know what you want and if you can't figure things out as you go
It's ok to not want something you worked so hard on getting - after realizing it wasn't what you thought it was.
It's ok to change your mind, to make mistakes, to walk away from someone you once loved - from something that once meant the world to you. It's okay, because this is your life, your cause, your body, your beliefs, your mind, your heart, and your feelings, and you don't need validation from no one, other than you, and I hope it doesn't take you a lifetime to realize that.
The fear of falling is worse than the fall itself.
Be you, not them.
